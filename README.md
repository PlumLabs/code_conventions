Here are the conventions followed in PlumLabs

## Formatting
* Use ASCII (or UTF-8, if you have to).
* Use 2 space indent, no tabs.
* Use Unix-style line endings. On the last line of the file, too.
* Use spaces around operators, after `,`, `:` and `;`, around `{` and
  before `}`.
* No spaces after `(`, `[` and before `]`, `)`.
* Use an empty line before the return value of a method (unless it
  only has one line), and an empty line between defs.
* Use empty lines to break up a long method into logical paragraphs.
* Keep lines fewer than 80 characters.
* Avoid trailing whitespace.
